This started as an assignment in the freecodecamp.org curriculum. 

The spec was managed by moving user stoies into the project management function of Github and, then, marching on...

I sought to match the spec example as if I'd been handed a .PSD or .PDF and told to "make this." However, I chose to implement it with CSS Grid, learning a number of things in the process, including how I would change the html on another pass. Given that, I chose not to include media queries in this version. 

I also added a thank-you.html for redirection after form submission. Since I wrote a server (server.js) for local dev, and the POST response is handled in the server, it is require to a) see the redirect and b) handle the req.body parsing.
