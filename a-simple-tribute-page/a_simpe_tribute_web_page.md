This is a simple tribute page created to fulfill an assignment on freecodecamp.org. 

I've chosen to use CSS Grid for the layout scheme. The color palette was developed using https://color.adobe.com. 

And...to go a little beyond the scope of the excercise, I chose to use a modern / mobile styled button that is activated with JavaScript instead of being a simple href. In order to pass the unit tests for this exercise, I did have to add an href to a source "more info" page. That's why there's a link on "Ernest Hemingway" in para1.
